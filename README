Backtest Repository
Written by Junior Quant (junior.quant1@gmail.com), website: http://juniorquant.wordpress.com/

Matlab code to backtest a buy and hold strategy, I use it with a different signal which I won't provide here.
Please feel free to code your own signal and use the libraries to backtest it.

Contact me for any questions.
